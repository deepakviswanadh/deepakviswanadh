# üë®üèª‚Äçüíª &nbsp;About Me

üí° &nbsp; I'm a Full Stack Polyglot Developer and a master's student at Northeastern University, passionate about building user-centric solutions. With a strong foundation in computer science and extensive hands-on experience, I thrive on designing, developing, and maintaining distributed systems that make a global impact.

üíª &nbsp; Currently, I am a Software Engineer Intern at Idaho National Laboratory, where I simplify the needs of end-users, one user at a time. My work involves enhancing both server-side logic and client-side functionality to deliver robust and responsive applications.

üéì&nbsp; I hold around 4 years of professional experience, during which I've honed my skills in various domains such as system design, microservices architecture, and performance optimization. I have a proven track record of reducing UI load times, improving system throughput, and implementing scalable solutions.

‚úçÔ∏è &nbsp; I'm particularly curious about security, performance optimization, and building high-performing yet simple software solutions. I enjoy tackling complex challenges and finding innovative ways to enhance system efficiency and reliability.

üí¨ &nbsp; Feel free to reach out to me for discussions on system design, distributed systems, performance optimization, or any other related topics. I am always eager to connect and share knowledge.
